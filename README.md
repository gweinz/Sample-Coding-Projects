# Sample-Coding-Projects
Examples of my best work thus far. All written in C++.

sheetsapi -> python script I developed for company I worked for that allows users to export local CSVs to their Google Drive with the ability to seperate spreadsheets by key values, and create corresponding tabs dictated by secondary keys on all spreadsheets. This is all done through a UI in terminal.

arb.py -> python script to isolate instances of betting arbitrages. in process of implementing automated betting.

FishFrenzy.java -> independant game written in java
